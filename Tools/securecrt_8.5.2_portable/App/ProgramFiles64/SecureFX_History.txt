---------------------------------------------------------

New feature:

  - Added support for the curve25519-sha256 key-exchange algorithm.

Bug fix:

  - If an OpenSSH format key was manually added to the host key
    database, SecureFX crashed when attempting to connect to a host
    that used that key.


Changes in SecureFX 8.5.1 (Official) -- September 27, 2018
----------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - The session channel window size was increased in order to use all
    available bandwidth for SCP downloads.
  - Mac: Dark Mode is disabled due to incompatibilities with MacOS 10.14
    (Mojave).

Bug fixes:

  - Windows: On Windows Server 2008 R2, the icons in the Session Manager
    and Connect dialog were not drawn correctly.
  - Windows/Mac: Synchronize operations that deleted local files did not
    honor the option "Move deleted files to the Recycle Bin/Trash".
  - Mac: After successfully updating using "Update Now" once, SecureFX
    could not be updated again using "Update Now".


Changes in SecureFX 8.5 (Official) -- August 28, 2018
-----------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - SecureFX crashed if an SCP session was closed immediately following
    an initial "cd" exec request.
  - SecureFX could crash if a new folder was created in the Session
    Manager or Connect dialog and there was at least one other folder
    under "Sessions" and then sorting was changed to manual arrangement
    and a session was dragged to be between the "Session" folder and the
    top folder.
  - Mac: The log pane got taller each time the folder tree was hidden
    and shown.


Changes in SecureFX 8.5 (Beta 5) -- August 16, 2018
---------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - If the global INI-file-only option "SecureFX Single Instance" was
    off and SecureFX was configured to log to a file, if a second
    instance of SecureFX was opened and the OK button was pressed on
    the dialog to select another log file and the file browse dialog was
    cancelled, SecureFX crashed.
  - SecureFX crashed when a folder that contained thousands of files was
    downloaded using SCP.
  - SFXCL: When /NoPrompt was specified for a session that used
    keyboard-interactive authentication and the session contained the
    password or it was specified on the command line, authentication
    failed.
  - Mac: When SecureCRT and SecureFX were integrated, if both
    SecureCRT and SecureFX were running and connected to a session and
    then SecureCRT was launched from SecureFX, the current session was
    opened in a tab in the SecureCRT window and in a new SecureCRT
    window.
  - Mac: SecureFX was unable to open a remote file if the "Open with"
    application was in a folder path that had spaces.


Changes in SecureFX 8.5 (Beta 4) -- August 9, 2018
--------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - The file listing for a remote system could be very slow when the
    folder contained many subfolders (over 10,000).
  - Pressing ENTER on the ".." folder no longer went up one level.
  - When the "pwd" command was issued to get the initial directory for
    the remote system and an error was returned, SecureFX attempted to
    use the error message as the path for the "cd" command.
  - Directories were not listed in sessions connected to a BusyBox
    device (Dropbear SSH) using SCP.
  - When OneDrive was disabled, it was displayed as a file rather than
    a folder.
  - The Beta expiration notice was displayed more frequently than it
    should have been when SecureFX was not closed and other instances
    of SecureFX were started/opened/launched.
  - Mac: When a session was configured to use GSSAPI authentication,
    if GSSAPI authentication failed, a warning dialog to this effect
    was still displayed when "Do not show this message again" was
    checked.
  - Mac/Linux: The ".." folder could be deleted using the Delete
    keyboard accelerator.
  - Mac/Linux: The keyboard shortcuts did not work in the Log pane.


Changes in SecureFX 8.5 (Beta 3) -- July 19, 2018
-------------------------------------------------

Change:

  - Pressing CTRL+B (or COMMAND+B on MacOS) in the tree view adds the
    selected folder to the list of bookmarks.


Changes in SecureFX 8.5 (Beta 2) -- July 10, 2018
-------------------------------------------------

No changes.


Changes in SecureFX 8.5 (Beta 1) -- June 28, 2018
-------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - The Manage Bookmarks dialog allows bookmarks to be edited, copied
    from another session, added, and deleted.
  - When "Open Bookmarks" is selected from the File menu or file view
    context menu, all the bookmarks are shown.  If there a lot of
    bookmarks, the list may have to be scrolled to see all of them. 
  - Added a global INI-file-only option called "SecureFX Single
    Instance", which is on by default.  If SecureFX is already running
    and a new SecureFX session is launched from SecureCRT, from the
    system desktop, or from the command line, the new session will open
    in the existing SecureFX application window.
  - Added support for the SHA2-512-EtM and SHA2-256-EtM MACs.
  - Added a global option to make the default action "Transfer" when a
    file is double-clicked or is selected and ENTER is pressed.
  - Sorting on columns is supported in all list controls that have
    columns.
  - Added a session INI-file-only option "Keyboard Interactive
    Prompt" that allows the expected prompt for keyboard-interactive
    authentication to be specified.
  - SFXCL: Added a /ReconnectCount flag to SFXCL that specifies the
    number of times to try to reconnect after a disconnect occurs
    during a transfer operation.
  - SFXCL: Added a /Parsable option to the /List command, which forces
    the list output to be displayed in MLSD/MLST format.
  - SFXCL: Added command-line option /MaxParallel that allows the
    maximum number of parallel transfers to be specified for transfer
    operations.
  - SFXCL: Added command-line option /TraceLevel that allows the
    trace output verbosity to be specified for all file operations.

Changes:

  - Improved the responsiveness of the user interface when multiple
    files are being transferred simultaneously.
  - The default action for pressing ENTER or double-clicking a file is
    transfer.  This setting can be changed in the Global Options dialog.
  - In the Public Key Properties dialog, the "Use identity or
    certificate file" field can be left blank.
  - Because of an update to a cryptographic library used by SecureFX,
    newly generated DSA keys are now restricted to 1024 bits.
  - Preceding and trailing whitespace is removed from hosts entered
    in the Connect bar.
  - The Manage Bookmarks dialog is resizable.
  - The keyboard shortcut ALT+N brings up the Session Manager or
    Connect dialog.
  - Migrated trace level option for sessions to a higher number
    because most of the messages that were previously traced at
    level 1 were moved to level 2.
  - The session option "Disable initial SFTP extensions" can now be
    configured in the GUI.
  - Windows: Improved transfer speeds by more than 25% when thousands
    of files are transferred in parallel using the transfer queue.
  - Windows: For the VS2013 Dark theme, the active tab's color was
    lightened and the highlight outline color for selected options on
    the toolbar was changed to orange.
  - Windows: The close button for the "Native" display theme is now a
    plain "X".

Bug fixes:

  - SecureFX crashed after closing a remote session tab and then
    entering text in the Session Manager's filter bar.
  - SecureFX could become non-responsive after uploading thousands of
    files listed individually using the transfer window instead of the
    transfer queue. 
  - In the Session Manager or Connect dialog, if a folder was renamed
    to have a name that was too long for the local system, the sessions
    contained in the folder were deleted.
  - On case-sensitive file systems, synchronize operations could
    incorrectly match or miss entries where the file or folder names
    only differed by case.
  - On case-sensitive file systems, the entry selected in the tree view
    after a file operation could be incorrect if the operation involved
    folders or files with names that only differed by case from other
    folders or files.
  - Remote edit would not upload files when changes were made without
    exiting the editor.
  - Files could not be uploaded to a folder that did not already exist
    on a Titan server when SFTP version 6 was used.
  - SFXCL: Usernames, passwords, and configuration passphrases
    containing non-ANSI characters could not be entered at an
    interactive prompt.
  - SFXCL: If "/S:i" was specified on the command line, the remote
    initial directory was ignored if the destination filename was
    different from the source filename.
  - Windows: If a file on the remote system had a timestamp with a year
    beyond 9999, SecureFX could crash when the folder containing that
    file was viewed.
  - Mac/Linux: Every launch of the context menu took longer and
    used more memory.
  - Mac/Linux: When drag and drop was used to initiate a transfer,
    the entire row of the destination folder was not highlighted.
  - Mac/Linux: The list of hosts in the Global Options dialog in the
    SSH Host Key category was not sorted.
  - Mac/Linux: If a session name contained two ampersands, the Window
    and File menus displayed the session name with three ampersands.
  - Mac: Filters did not work correctly for the local window if the
    file system was case sensitive.
  - Linux: SFXCL crashed if it was run before SecureFX had ever
    been launched.
