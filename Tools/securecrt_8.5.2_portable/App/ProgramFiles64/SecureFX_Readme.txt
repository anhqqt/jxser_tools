Product Overview
----------------

SecureFX is a flexible, secure file transfer client with a tabbed
visual interface that’s easy to learn.  Advanced features like site 
synchronization and automation help web designers and system admin-
istrators streamline everyday tasks.  SecureFX delivers strong 
security with support for SFTP, FTP over TLS, SCP and FTP.  When 
you connect to a site that supports SSH2, SecureFX has everything 
you need to create a fully-encrypted SFTP session.

With SecureFX, it’s easier than ever to perform secure file transfers.
Establish a secure connection with a mouse click, or type a server name
in the Connect Bar, and then drag and drop files to start transfers to
and from a server and your desktop. On Windows platforms, you can even
drag and drop files between SecureFX and applications like Windows
Explorer and WinZip.  The SFXCL command-line utility allows you to
automate unattended file transfers (Windows only).

SecureFX works to complete interrupted transfers, with a resume on
multi-transfer mode and a “Relentless” transfer mode that automatic-
ally reconnects and resumes transfers when connections are broken.

SecureFX site synchronization handles upload, download, and true 
mirroring transfers as well as server-to-server synchronization.  
Mirroring includes automatically deleting files or folders that are 
not on the source directory from the destination directory, allowing 
you to exactly match the destination and source.  Filters for 
synchronize operations allow you to control which files and folders 
are affected.  For one-click synchronization, use the "Quick 
Synchronize" dialog to configure your synchronization settings;
then press a toolbar button to initiate a synchronize operation 
using those settings.  If you need to keep more than one remote site 
synchronized, the "Synchronize" dialog lets you create, save, and 
manage session synchronizations and initiate comparison operations. 
Commonly used configurations can be saved in the synchronize database
for quick recall.

Quickly find the files you want to work with using the filter view,
bookmarks, and the address bar.  The Session Manager lets you arrange 
hundreds of sites any way you like, and named sessions allow you to 
save preferences for individual sites.  A personal data folder 
provides private and separate storage of usernames, passwords, and 
automated logon information so that other configuration data can be 
stored on a network drive or in the cloud for use on different
systems or for sharing with colleagues.  Named firewalls can be used
on a session-specific basis so that you can work from multiple 
locations with different firewalls.  SecureFX also provides support
for IPv6 and the ability to run multiple instances of the application.

If you need both terminal emulation and file transfer, SecureCRT(R)
and SecureFX are closely integrated, sharing sessions and settings so
that you can run SFTP, FTP, SCP, and FTP/TLS file transfer sessions
without reentering passwords.  Or for a complete file transfer
solution, combine SecureFX with the VShell(R) server to provide fine-
tuned file transfer privileges on a user or group basis.

SecureFX includes a 30-day try-before-you-buy evaluation license for
the fully functional application and access to VanDyke Software(R)
technical support.

1. New for SecureFX 8.5
-----------------------

SecureFX 8.5 improves your workflow with a Bookmark Manager for adding,
deleting, editing, and copying bookmarks as well as other bookmark 
enhancements.  Externally launched sessions automatically open in the 
existing SecureFX application window.  SFXCL enhancements give you more 
options for automated file transfers.

Here are some of the new features in SecureFX 8.5:

Bookmark enhancements

  A Bookmark Manager makes it easier for you to add, delete, and edit 
  bookmarks as well as copy them from another session.  The File menu 
  and the file view context menu now show all bookmarks.

Single application window

  If SecureFX is already running and a new SecureFX session is
  launched from SecureCRT, from the system desktop, or from the
  command line, the new session will open in the existing SecureFX
  application window.

SFXCL enhancements

  New parameters have been added for customizing output and to give
  you more options for automated file transfers.

Please see the History tab in the SecureFX About Box for information
on changes and bug fixes.
