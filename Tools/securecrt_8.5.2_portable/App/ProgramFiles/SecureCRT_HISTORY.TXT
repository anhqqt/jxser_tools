Changes in SecureCRT 8.5.2 (Official) -- November 15, 2018
----------------------------------------------------------

New feature:

  - Added support for the curve25519-sha256 key-exchange algorithm.

Bug fixes:

  - If an OpenSSH format key was manually added to the host key
    database, SecureCRT crashed when attempting to connect to a host
    that used that key.
  - If the Session Manager was pinned and the active session had keyword
    highlighting on and it was toggled off by selecting "Keyword
    Highlighting" from the Options menu and then the Session Manager was
    hidden, keyword highlighting was re-enabled.
  - Windows: In the Command Window, if the option "Send Characters
    Immediately" was set, pressing CTRL+A selected all the text in the
    Command Window instead of sending the CTRL+A to the session(s).
  - Windows: When using the mouse wheel to scroll session output, there
    was a dead spot in the terminal area where scrolling stopped if the
    mouse cursor was positioned there.
  - Windows: Attempting to display the Activator's About box caused an
    error message to be displayed.
  - Mac/Linux: If the Session Manager was undocked and redocked, the
    terminal area size changed.
  - Mac: SecureCRT could crash if a session had a dependent session and
    the wrong password had been saved for both sessions and the wrong
    password was entered when attempting to connect to the session.
  - Mac: If CTRL+<down arrow> was used to select multiple folders in the
    Session Manager or Connect dialog and then arrow keys were pressed,
    the selection could not be cleared.
  - Linux: On Ubuntu 18.x, when running Midnight Commander, if CTRL+O
    was used to show and hide panels until there was no command prompt
    and then Midnight Commander was restarted as root and CTRL+O was 
    used to hide panels, the command prompt was at the top of the window
    and new output was displayed incorrectly.


Changes in SecureCRT 8.5.1 (Official) -- September 27, 2018
-----------------------------------------------------------

New feature:

  - Added a new script function FileSaveDialog() that allows saving to
    a file that does not exist.

Bug fixes:

  - If the command line specified a saved session (/S) and overrode the
    local listening IP address (/LOCAL), an error was reported and the
    session did not connect.
  - The button bar list was empty if button bars were imported when the
    button bar list was not displayed and then the button bar was
    displayed.
  - Windows: On Windows Server 2008 R2, the icons in the Session Manager
    and Connect dialog were not drawn correctly.
  - Windows: On a high-DPI monitor scaled to 125%, the 10-point Lucida
    Console font looked larger and bold compared to how that font looked
    in other applications.
  - Mac: After successfully updating using "Update Now" once, SecureCRT
    could not be updated again using "Update Now".
  - Mac: The dialog for customizing the toolbar was displayed over the
    toolbar so that items could not be dragged into the toolbar.

Change:

  - Mac: Dark Mode is disabled due to incompatibilities with MacOS 10.14
    (Mojave).


Changes in SecureCRT 8.5 (Official) -- August 28, 2018
------------------------------------------------------

Bug fix:

  - SecureCRT could crash if a new folder was created in the Session
    Manager or Connect dialog and there was at least one other folder
    under "Sessions" and then sorting was changed to manual arrangement
    and a session was dragged to be between the "Session" folder and the
    top folder.


Changes in SecureCRT 8.5 (Beta 5) -- August 16, 2018
----------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - Mac: When SecureCRT and SecureFX were integrated, if both
    SecureCRT and SecureFX were running and connected to a session and
    then SecureCRT was launched from SecureFX, the current session was
    opened in a tab in the SecureCRT window and in a new SecureCRT
    window.
  - Mac: SecureCRT could, under rare circumstances, crash when
    "Page Setup" was selected from the File menu.


Changes in SecureCRT 8.5 (Beta 4) -- August 9, 2018
---------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - Scripts specified in custom keymaps and mapped keys were not
    included when settings were exported and imported.
  - The Beta expiration notice was displayed more frequently than it
    should have been when SecureCRT was not closed and other instances
    of SecureCRT were started/opened/launched.
  - Windows: On Windows 10, SecureCRT sometimes crashed when an SFTP
    tab was opened from a session that logged to a mapped network
    drive and the drive was not available.
  - Windows: If the session option "Disable resize" was on, the
    application window could be resized when the display theme was set
    to VS2013 Blue, VS2013 Black, or Office 2013.
  - Mac: If settings were exported to a network share (SMB), the XML
    file was blank.
  - Mac: If a session was imported from another platform and the
    session's font did not exist on MacOS, the terminal text was not
    displayed correctly.
  - Mac: When a session was configured to use GSSAPI authentication,
    if GSSAPI authentication failed, a warning dialog to this effect
    was still displayed when "Do not show this message again" was
    checked.
  - Mac: When the Confirm Multi-Line Paste dialog was displayed, focus
    was in the edit box instead of on the Paste button.


Changes in SecureCRT 8.5 (Beta 3) -- July 19, 2018
--------------------------------------------------

Bug fix:

  - Windows: Custom menu toolbar icons were displayed incorrectly
    when the system text was scaled to 125%.

--------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - If three or more sessions were opened in three separate tab groups
    and the middle tab group was made wider, the tab widths were not
    adjusted correctly.  Similarly, if the application window was made
    wider, the tabs widths in the right tab group were not adjusted
    correctly.
  - Windows: SSH2 sessions failed to connect if the username contained
    international characters (e.g., Cyrillic) and the local system's
    code page was not the same as the remote system's code page.
  - Windows: If session tabs were not shown, when multiple instances of
    SecureCRT were opened, each subsequent instance of SecureCRT was
    slightly shorter.

    attempting to select a different category in the Session Options
    dialog.
  - In the Session Manager or Connect dialog, if a folder was renamed
    to have a name that was too long for the local system, the sessions
    contained in the folder were deleted.
  - SecureCRT hung when running a Python script that called
    crt.Screen.Send("\000).
  - SecureCRT failed to authenticate with remote systems, such as
    the Balabit PPM SSH proxy server, that requested the same 
    authentication method more than once during authentication.

    escape characters [chr(92)] were not included in the script.
  - When exporting settings, scripts that were used by buttons were
    not exported.
  - If keyword highlighting was turned on through a script, the
    terminal window was not updated to highlight the keywords.
  - The multi-line paste dialog did not display the text correctly
    if the session was using the vt100 font and the configuration
    data was from a version of SecureCRT between 6.0 and 6.2.

    emojis and certain Asian characters were rendered incorrectly or
    as unknown characters in the terminal area.
  - Some double-wide Unicode characters could not be used in keyword
    highlighting.

    wider, when SecureCRT restarted, the Session Manager's size
    change was lost.
  - Windows: After SecureCRT had been running for a while, switching
    tabs could become very slow.
  - Windows: If the combined SecureCRT and SecureFX installer had
    previously been installed and then a newer standalone version
    of SecureCRT was installed, SecureCRT's menu bar was blank.
  - Windows: On a 4K monitor, if a session's resize option was set
    to "Synchronize view to size" and the view was zoomed several
    times, the prompt could end up off the screen and/or lines
    could be cut off.
  - Windows: If the EOL character for the text in the clipboard was
    not CRLF, line breaks were not displayed correctly in the
    multi-line paste confirmation dialog.

    starting and stopping the TFTP server and the TFTP server failed
    to start, the button said "Stop TFTP Server."
  - Windows: In the Windows 10 Creators Update, the Session Manager
    and Connect dialog could be unresponsive for several seconds when
    they were displayed.
  - Windows: In the Windows 10 Creators Update, the Connect dialog
    could take several seconds to draw the toolbar.
